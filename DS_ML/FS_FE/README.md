# Feature Selection and Feature Engineering  

An educational talk about Feature Selection and Feature Engineering and why it matters.  

## What this education talk is  
- an introduction to why feature selection is an essential step in building DS and ML pipelines.  
- an introduction to basic feature engineering.  

## What this education talk is NOT  
- an exhaustive guide to feature engineering.  
- a one-fits-all solution guide.  

## Objective of this education talk  
establish an intuition about where to focus efforts when creating DS and ML pipelines.  
(assuming a dataset post preparation and cleaning steps is available)

## Modules and Materials Collection  
_Note:_ the content of this education talk is also being used in presentations.  

### Slides  
[slide deck](content/FS_FE_slides.pdf) used in the presentations and video materials  

### Jupyter Notebooks
used in the presentations and video materials.  
**Note:** these notebooks have been developed using older versions of packages (particularly scikit-learn). They have not been verified with current versions.
