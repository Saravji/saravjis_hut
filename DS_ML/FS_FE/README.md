# Feature Selection and Feature Engineering  

An overview learning path about Feature Selection and Feature Engineering and why it matters.  

## What this learning path is  
- an introduction to why feature selection is an essential step in building DS and ML pipelines.  
- an introduction to basic feature engineering.  

## What this learning path is NOT  
- an exhaustive guide to feature engineering.  
- a one-fits-all solution guide.  

## Objective of this learning path  
establish an intuition about where to focus efforts when creating DS and ML pipelines.  
(assuming a dataset post preparation and cleaning steps is available)

## Modules and Materials Collection  
_Note:_ the content of this learning path is also being used in presentations.
