## About Piracy

Effectively, I cannot prevent anyone from pirating or using my works in a way different than intended.  
However, I ask to consider that the materials made available constitute a significant investment. If it would be your efforts / time / monetary contributions, would you not appreciate if folks would show ethical behavior?  
So, why not support and respect the rights?
