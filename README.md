## Expected Conduct
For the time being, I'll keep comments open on all platforms.  
I expect that everyone treats these areas as a community space and behaves towards others the same way they want to be treated:  
*be courteous, polite and respectful.  
don't talk about religious, political or other polarizing topics.*  
I expressly reserve the option to close down comments. (And no, I will not be spending my time moderating, I rather create content.)

## About Piracy

Effectively, I cannot prevent anyone from pirating or using my works in a way different than intended.  
However, I ask to consider that the materials made available constitute a significant investment. If it would be your efforts / time / monetary contributions, would you not appreciate if folks would show ethical behavior?  
So, why not support and respect the rights?
