## LAB 06-B: Returning Tuples

In this Lab, you create a function that returns multiple values.  

1.	Make a copy of the script from LAB 06-A and save it as Lab06_B.
2.	Modify the script so all four calculations are done in one function. This function returns all four calculation results at the same time.
3.	Test the script and make sure it works.
