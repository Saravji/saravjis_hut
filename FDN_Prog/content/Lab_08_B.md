# Foundations of Programming (Python)  

## LAB 08-B: Working with Constructors:  

In this Lab, we’ll add a constructor to the class we created in Lab 08-A.  

1.	Make a copy of Lab08_A.py and save it as Lab08_B.py  
2.	Add code to create a constructor.  
3.	Add code to populate the class fields.  
4.	Test the class and make sure it works.  

**One note about testing:** Make sure to test that the script works as expected (with ‘good’ values).  
But also think about what values to use to test that you can’t break your script.  
These tests typically are more efficient.
