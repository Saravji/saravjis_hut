# Foundations of Programming (Python)  

## LAB 08-C: Working with Attributes:

In this Lab, we’ll add attributes to the class we created in Lab 08-B.  

1.	Make a copy of Lab08_B.py and save it as Lab08_C.py
2.	Add code to create attributes.
3.	Add code to populate the class attributes.
4.	Test the class and write down how the code works.


**One note about testing:** Make sure to test that the script works as expected (with ‘good’ values).  
But also think about what values to use to test that you can’t break your script.  
These tests typically are more efficient.
