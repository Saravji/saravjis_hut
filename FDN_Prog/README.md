# Foundations of Programming (Python)

An introductory learning path to programming, using python.  
Exploring the logical part (how to think like a Programmer).  
Explaining the technical part (how to speak "Computer").

## What this learning path is
- A rapid and practical introduction to computer programming and application development.
- For learners with little or no programming experience.
- For learners who would benefit from a refresher learning path.
- For learners looking to explore if programming "is for them".
- Exploring fundamental components and constructs of computer programming.
- Exploring the logic of programming.
- Exploring different programming paradigms.

## What this learning path is NOT
- This learning path is not a python course - It will use python as a tool and focus not only on the syntax, but also the logic of programming. 
- This learning path will not adhere python conventions - It will introduce many valid conventions found throughout the software industry.

## Objective of this learning path
Learners completing this learning path will be able to:
- demonstrate basic computer programming concepts.
- explain the software design process, including consideration of some common design trade-offs.
- program in a modern programming language.
- create non-trivial programs in Python.
- recognize programming paradigms and concepts.
